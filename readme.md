    This project uses vid.puffyan.us (see above) ,a invidious instance , for its videos. 
    Our site takes no responsibilty for copyright since we simply use invidious's videos.

Our project was inspired by the user Kai_BizzBizz. They gave us the idea to make a website where people can just watch adverts that are chosen from a random array of videos supplied by invidious.

<h1 style="text-align:center;">Why are there no folders or organisation.</h1>
This github repo is designed so when it is downloaded it can be very drag and drop for your web server file system. Also there was no need for folders as the code isnt that complicated.
