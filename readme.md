    This project uses vid.puffyan.us (see above) ,a invidious instance , for its videos. 
    Our site takes no responsibilty for copyright since we simply use invidious's videos.

Our project was inspired by the user Kai_BizzBizz. They gave us the idea to make a website where people can just watch adverts that are chosen from a random array of videos supplied by invidious.
