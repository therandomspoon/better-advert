There are quite a few setbacks regarding APIs for this site. I am a novice programmer who have not really used APIs in my life but invidious' APIs seem simple enough to utilise compared to youtubes. The main setback is the Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) policy. Most modern browsers utilise this policy strictly which makes it incredibly hard to get around. One way to get around this would be to use invidious media servers but i honestly have no idea how to do any of that. For those of you who dont know the Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) is a security feature implemented in web browsers to prevent unauthorized access to resources (like APIs, fonts, images, etc.) on a web page served from a different origin (domain, protocol, or port) than the one that served the web page itself. It is a critical security mechanism used to protect users and prevent potential cross-site request forgery (CSRF) and cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.
